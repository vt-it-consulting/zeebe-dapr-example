# Zeebe Dapr Example

An example that allows to orchestrate [Dapr] microservices with the [Zeebe] process engine.

This example contains a .NET microservice that will be orchestrated with the [Zeebe] process engine. The example uses
the Dapr [input](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/zeebe-jobworker/)/[output](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-bindings/zeebe-command/) bindings for Zeebe.

The repository contains a simple Zeebe [BPMN] process:
![Alt text](process.png?raw=true "Calc process")

The process can be viewed or edited with either the web based tooling from [BPMN.IO] or you can download the [Desktop Modeler].

The microservice contains the following endpoints:

| Endpoint                     | Description                                                              |

| `command/publish-message`    | Publishes a message                                                      |

| `command/update-job-retries` | Updates the job retries                                                  |
| `command/throw-error`        | Throws an error for a job                                                |
| `calc`                       | Worker implementation that will be executed by the Zeebe process engine  |

## Setup Zeebe locally

Camunda provides the [camunda-platform] repository with different docker compose configurations. We use the `docker-compose-core` configuration, which is 
good for development purposes and provides the [Operate] UI.

The following tools need to be installed on the local developer machine. Please refer to the documentation of these tools to learn how to
install them.
- [Docker]
- [Docker compose]

The following commands must be executed to run Zeebe:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camunda/camunda-platform.git
docker compose -f docker-compose-core.yaml up
```

**Note:** If you try to run this example on a M1 Mac, then you need to update the zeebe, operate and tasklist images to version 8.2.0-alpha4. 
You also needs to remove the connector part from the docker compose file.

After all services are started the following URIs can be used:

| Tool          | URI                   |
|---------------|-----------------------|
| Operate       | http://localhost:8081 |
| Tasklist      | http://localhost:8082 |
| Zeebe Gateway | localhost:26500       |

The default username and password is: `demo`

# Run the worker service

The following command will run the service `Zeebe.Worker` with dapr. The repo contains some example requests in the `requests` folder, 
which can be executed against the service.

```bash
dotnet run --project "./Zeebe.Worker/Zeebe.Worker.csproj"
```
